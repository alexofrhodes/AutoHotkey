NOTE! this is set to run immediately on selected files so you can't click-to-run  
add a hotkey or look at my "shell" or "file ops" for ideas on how to call it  

For each selected zip,  
-if it contains a single folder then unzip it here  
-else create a folder named after it and put the file inside
